# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to generate simple logos and save them as SVG files. Users can input text, choose colors, and select a shape for the logo, and the application will create a corresponding SVG file based on these inputs. This tool is especially useful for freelance web developers who need to create basic logos without hiring a graphic designer.
